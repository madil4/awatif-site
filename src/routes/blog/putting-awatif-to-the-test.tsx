        offered to help test Awatif, which is the first online parametric
        structural engineering software. I told him to be ruthless with it, and
        he responded that he would do his worst ðŸ˜…. I was amused by how he
        managed to script a sphere model in a fraction of the time and with just
        a few lines of code. The script can serve as the foundation for
        designing a dome roof or a similar structure.
