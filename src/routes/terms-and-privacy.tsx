      <Title>Awatif - Terms and Privacy</Title>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-5">License Agreement</h2>
      <p class="mb-5">
        The following terms and conditions apply to all agreements, contracts,
        and legal actions between Mohamed Elsayed (licensor) and customers
        (referred to as "customer"). By installing or using the software
        (referred to as "program(s)"), the customer agrees to be bound by the
        terms and conditions of this license. If the customer violates any of
        these restrictions, the license will automatically expire. The granted
        license defines the customer's rights, and it is only valid if the
        program was lawfully acquired.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">1- License Terms</h3>
      <p class="mb-5">
        The free-version of Awatif is strictly for personal and/or
        non-commercial use. The pro-version is intended for commercial purposes.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-5">
        The licensor grants the customer a nonassignable, nonexclusive,
        nontransferable right to use the acquired program(s). This right is
        valid for the customer's own use, the use of their employees, or the use
        of contract users for a specified period depending on the license type.
        A contract user refers to an individual or entity engaged to perform
        internal data processing services for the customer, who is not a regular
        employee.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-5">
        The customer may only use the program(s) for internal data processing
        and must not make any part of the program(s) available to third parties,
        except for the customer's employees and contract users for internal data
        processing purposes. Internal data processing purposes include using the
        program(s) for consulting services but do not include providing data
        processing services, acting as an application service provider, or
        offering batch processing services.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-5">
        Transferring the program(s) or any part thereof to a third party is not
        permitted without prior written notification and consent from the
        licensor. The software remains the property of the licensor, and no
        title, ownership, copyright, or intellectual property rights are
        conveyed to the customer unless explicitly granted in writing.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">2- Fees and Prices</h3>
      <p class="mb-5">
        New prices published in the online web-shop supersede all previous
        prices.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">3- Disclaimer of Warranty</h3>
      <p class="mb-5">
        To the extent permitted by applicable law, the program is provided "as
        is" without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied. The licensor
        does not provide any warranties, including merchantability and fitness
        for a particular purpose. The customer assumes all risks associated with
        the quality and performance of the program. If the program is defective,
        the customer is responsible for any necessary servicing, repair, or
        correction.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">4- Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <p class="mb-5">
        Unless required by applicable law or agreed upon in writing, the
        licensor is not liable to the customer for any damages, including
        general, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the
        use or inability to use the program(s). This includes data loss,
        inaccurate data, losses incurred by the customer or third parties, or
        failure of the program to operate with other programs, even if advised
        of the possibility of such damages.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">5- Other Conditions</h3>
      <p class="mb-5">
        Agreement with these terms and conditions is assumed unless explicitly
        disagreed upon in writing. If any provision of the terms and conditions
        is found to be invalid or incomplete, it does not affect the validity of
        the remaining provisions. In such cases, the ineffective provision will
        be replaced with an appropriate and effective regulation that fulfills
        legal and commercial purposes, if legally possible.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">6- Final Provisions</h3>
      <p class="mb-5">
        This contract shall be governed exclusively by the laws of the
        Netherlands. The place of execution, jurisdiction for deliveries and
        payments, as well as the resolution of disputes, is Amsterdam, the
        Netherlands. The licensor is entitled to bring legal action against
        customers before the appropriate court of law. The parties to this
        contract agree that this contract and any claims arising from or in
        connection with this contract shall be governed by the laws of the
        Netherlands, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the
        International Sale of Goods.
